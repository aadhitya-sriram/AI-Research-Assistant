Introduction
Secure Key Exchange: Foundation of cryptographic
communication, enabling safety over untrusted networks;
traditional Diffie-Hellman is limited to two-party
scenarios.
Multi-Party Demand: Distributed systems like
blockchains and IoT require scalable, secure key
exchange across many participants.
Current Limitations: Existing MPDH methods suffer
from O(n²) communication, poor scalability, and
vulnerability to collusion.
Quantum Threat: Shor’s algorithm breaks classical DH,
urging adoption of quantum-resistant key exchange
mechanisms.
Paper ID: XXX
Introduction
Authentication Issues: Scaling authentication in
multi-party settings is difficult, increasing
exposure to man-in-the-middle attacks.
Diffie-Hellman Core: Relies on discrete log
problem; naive extensions to multi-party systems
demand excessive communication.
Threshold Cryptography: Splits trust among
participants, tolerates partial compromise, and
increases system resilience.
Hybrid Solutions: Combine post-quantum and
threshold cryptography, cut complexity to O(n log
n), and ensure future-proof security.

Motivation and Problem Statment
Motivation:
Growing need for secure multi-party communication in distributed
systems
Blockchain networks, IoT ecosystems, and secure multi-party
computation require robust key exchange
Traditional two-party Diffie-Hellman inadequate for modern distributed
architectures
Quantum computing threatens existing cryptographic foundations
Problem Statement:
Current Multi-Party Diffie-Hellman (MPDH) approaches face critical
limitations
Quadratic O(n²) communication complexity creating severe scalability
issues
Vulnerability to collusion attacks compromising system-wide security
Susceptibility to quantum computing attacks via Shor's algorithm
Authentication challenges in efficiently verifying multiple participants
Paper ID: XXX
Literature Review
Diffie-Hellman Evolution
Original Diffie-Hellman work introduced public-key cryptography concept
Ingemarsson et al. extended DH to multiple parties requiring n rounds for n participants
Burmester and Desmedt improved efficiency with two-round protocol and O(n)
complexity
Kim et al. proposed Tree-based Group Diffie-Hellman (TGDH) reducing complexity to
O(log n)
Authentication & Security Models
SIGMA protocol integrated identity verification to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
Jarecki et al. (2020) developed password-authenticated key exchange for groups
Bresson et al. extended Bellare-Rogaway model to formal security for group settings
Paper ID: XXX
Literature Review
Paper ID: XXX
Forward Secrecy & Post-Quantum Approaches
Cremers and Feltz (2015) examined one-round key
exchange with perfect forward secrecy
Zhang et al. (2018) proposed lattice-based methods
providing quantum attack resistance
SIDH (Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman) offers another
quantum-resistant approach
Threshold Cryptography Development
Shamir's Secret Sharing laid foundation for threshold
cryptography
Pedersen expanded threshold concepts for distributed
systems
Komlo and Goldberg (2020) developed FROST for efficient
threshold signatures in blockchain
Gagol et al. (2019) introduced proactive refreshing of
threshold keys to prevent gradual compromise
Literature Review
Paper ID: XXX
Blockchain Integration
Kokoris-Kogias et al. (2018) proposed CALYPSO for privacy-preserving
data sharing using threshold cryptography in blockchain
Schindler implemented threshold signatures in Ethereum smart
contracts
Zhou investigated multi-party computation for secure key management
in decentralized finance
Research Gaps Identified
Most solutions address only specific aspects of multi-party key
exchange
Limited work on integrating post-quantum security with threshold
approaches
Efficiency challenges remain in large-scale deployments
No comprehensive solution addresses all key challenges:
Quantum resistance
Collusion protection
Communication efficiency
Authentication at scale
Practical deployment considerations

ecosystems, and secure multi-party computation
Proposed Methodology

Proposed Methodology
Paper ID: XXX
Phase 1 - Base Key Establishment
Modified Burmester-Desmedt Protocol with Hierarchical
tree Structure:
Each participant Pi:
Generates private key x ∈ Zi q
Computes public value y = g mod pi xi
Computes shared secrets Z = (y ) mod p with
adjacent nodes
i,j j xi
Uses hierarchical balanced binary tree structure
Reduces complexity from O(n) to O(n log n)
Each participant communicates with only O(log n)
others instead of all n participants
Ideal for large networks with direct communication
Proposed Methodology
Paper ID: XXX
Phase 2 - Threshold Security Layer
Based on Shamir's Secret Sharing (t,n)-threshold mechanism
Each participant Pi:
Computes contribution c = H(Z || Z || ... || Z )i i,1 i,2 i,n
Creates polynomial fi(x) = c + a x + a x + ... + a xi i,1 i,2 2 i,t-1 t-1
Distributes shares s = f (j) privately to othersi,j i
Publishes Feldman's VSS commitments V = gi,k ai,k
Any t participants can recover contributions using Lagrange
interpolation
Global threshold value T = H(T || T || ... || T )1 2 n
Provides resilience against adversaries controlling fewer
than t participants
Proposed Methodology
Paper ID: XXX
Phase 3 - Post-Quantum Hardening
Ring-LWE Based Quantum Resistance
Each participant:
Samples polynomial a from R = Z [x]/(x + 1)q q n
Computes b = a·s + e with secret si and error eii i i
Broadcasts (a, b ) to all participantsi
Computes v = b ·s ≈ a·s ·s with each participanti,j j i i j
Derives quantum-resistant component Qi
Final key combines all phases:
K = KDF(y || y || ... || y || T || Q || Q || ... || Q )1 2 n 1 2 n
Provides security against potential quantum attacks
